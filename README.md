# PageLess

PageLess is a responsive start page developed to show the capabilities of the Less.js framework. It was made after creating my previous project fresh-start, and wanting to make a new start page, re-imagined, from scratch.

## Installation

Install my-project with git

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SlipperyDuck777/pageless.git
  cd pageless
```
    
## Usage/Examples

1. Download extension that redirects your new tab ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) / [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/))
2. Set the path of `index.html` where you chose to download the repository into the URL field of the extension settings. Alternatively you can set the URL field to the following if you would not like to host the files from your computer: https://slipperyduck777.github.io/fresh-start/. Unfortunately you need to host the files locally to save your customizations, as the feature to do so is a work in progress and is not expected to be implemented in the near future.
3. If properly configured, you should see Fresh Start every time you open a new tab. If the browser does not display Fresh Start you must tweak your browsers settings to display the previously specified path when opening a new instance.
